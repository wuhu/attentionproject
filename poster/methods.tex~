To evaluate the UVAM algorithm we used the Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100, http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php). Therefor we extracted the 75 first objects containing the largest amount of keypoints and neglected all others. In addition, we only used objects without rotation. These objects were embedded into backgrounds taken from the McGill Calibrated Colour Image Database (http://tabby.vision.mcgill.ca/). An example test image is illustrated in Fig. 2.\\
